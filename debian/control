Description: Web-interface for CVS and Subversion version control repositories
 ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control 
 repositories. It generates templatized HTML to present navigable 
 directory, revision, and change log listings. It can display specific 
 versions of files as well as diffs between those versions. Basically, 
 ViewVC provides the bulk of the report-like functionality you expect out 
 of your version control tool, but much more prettily than the average 
 textual command-line program output.
